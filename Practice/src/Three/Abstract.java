	 	--->abstract classes may or may not have abstract methods.

	 	--->abstract methods can’t be private.
	 	--->abstract classes can have any number of constructors.
	 	--->abstract methods can’t be static. but abstract inner classes can be static.
	 	--->Yes. Abstract classes can have static initialization blocks as well as instance initialization blocks.
	 	--->Abstract methods can’t be final.
	 	Abstract methods can not be declared as synchronized.
	 	--->abstract methods can be declared with throws clause.
	 	--->Abstract classes are not 100% abstract because of concrete constructors.
	 	--->Overloaded methods can be abstract or concrete.
	 	
	 	--->You know that we can’t create objects to an abstract class. 
	 		Then, why it is allowed to have constructors in an abstract class?
		Answer :
			Because, these constructors will be called in constructor chaining.
